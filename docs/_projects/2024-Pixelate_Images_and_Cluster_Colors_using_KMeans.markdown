<!-- BACKGROUND -->
<div class='mt-5 mb-5' id='background'>
  <h3 class='mb-3'><u>BACKGROUND</u></h3>
  <p>One of my hobbies is designing and creating yarn crafts, I wanted to use C2C technique in crochet to make blankets and needed a reliable (and free) way of creating pixelated images and group/cluster the colors in the image to a reasonable number (it would be awfully difficult to make a blanket with 200 different shades of each color ðŸ˜†). So I figured why not write a Python code to do exactly this! All code and example usgage can be seen in my GitHub repo.</p>
  <p>The pixelation process is written in vanilla Python, while K-Means clustering is used to group the colors. All work was done in Google Colab (Free). Notable Python packages used:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>standard: numpy, pandas</li>
      <li>image processing: PIL Image</li>
      <li>modeling: scikit-learn</li>
      <li>visualization: matplotlib</li>
      <li>parameter validation: pydantic</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<div class='mt-5 mb-5' id='overview'>
  <h3 class='mb-3'><u>OVERVIEW</u></h3>
  <p>The entire algorithm is wrapped in one class called Processed. When I first wrote the code, I first wrote the steps outside of functions, then I wrapped the steps in functions for better visibility and at the end wrapped all functions within the one class. The class accepts six parameters as inputs, <a href='https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/'>Pydantic</a> is used to validate the parameters (see ProcessImageInput class). The contains n supporting methods in addition to __init__() to process the image based on the specified parameters.</p>
  
<!-- PARAMETERS -->
<div class='mt-5 mb-5' id='parameters'>
  <h3 class='mb-3'><u>PARAMETERS</u></h3>
  <p>The six supported parameters are as follows.</p>
  <ol>
    <li class='mb-3'>input_image_path: str 
      <ul>
        <li>Path to the input image file.</li>
        <li>Called by the _process_image() function within the class to load the image from the specified path.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class='mb-3'>resize_ratio: float
      <ul>
        <li>The ratio by which the image should be resized. Default=0.1</li>
        <li>Called by the resize_image() function within the class to resize the image.</li>
        <li>Only positive values are accepted.</li>
        <li>Values between 0 and 1 decrease the image size while values > 1 increase the image size.</li>
        <li>Images are sized to proportion of the original image.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class='mb-3'>grid_size: int
      <ul>
        <li>The size of the grid for pixelation. Default=10</li>
        <li>Called by the resize_image() function within the class to adjust the size the image to be divisible by the grid size to prepare for pixelation.</li>
        <li>Called by the image_pixelates() function within the class to pixelate the image based on the specified size. Below is a visualization of what the grid_size represents.</li>
        <li>Only positive values are accepted.</li>
        <li>Images can be viewed as representations of little boxes (ie, pixels). See below example, if our image is of size (6x6), a grid_size=3 would cover each of the (3x3) grid within the image, the grids are non-overlapping. Our (6x6) image can then be represented with four (3x3) grids.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class='mb-3'>do_reduce: bool
      <ul>
        <li>Flag indicating whether to reduce the number of colors using k-means clustering. Default=False</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li class='mb-3'>cluster_metric: str
      <ul>
        <li>Method for identifying number of clusters. Default='ch'</li>
        <li>Ignored if do_reduce == False.</li>
        <li>Acceptable inputs are as follows. The spelling of the input has to be exact as the supporting functions for the methods are dynamically called based on the string passed in.
          <ul>
            <li>'sil': <a href='https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html'>silhouette method</a></li>
            <li>'db': <a href='https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.davies_bouldin_score.html'>davies bouldin method</a></li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Another commonly used technique for identifying optimal number of clusters is by using the <a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/elbow-method-for-optimal-value-of-k-in-kmeans/'>Elbow method</a> of visually inspect the number of clusters and the respective WCSS value for that cluster. As this method requires visual inspection, it is not as systematic as the other methods, so I did not implement this method in the algorithm.</li>

    </li>
    <li class='mb-3'>num_colors: int
      <ul>
        <li>Maximum number of colors/clusters to reduce to. Default=12</li>
        <li>Ignored if do_reduce == False.</li>
        <li>Must be >= 2.</li>

  <!-- Cat -->
  <h4 class='mb-3'><u>Cat</u></h4>
  <p>For experimentation, I found an image of a cat from Google, first rendered the pixelated image without clustering, with resize_ratio=1.1 and grid_size=5, then rendered the pixelated image with the three different methods of clustering (each with the same num_colors=12), while holding the other parameters constant. Below is a comparison of the images at different stages.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="/assets/img/projects/pixelate_kmeans/cat_original.png" alt="original cat image">
      <p>original cat image</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="/assets/img/projects/pixelate_kmeans/cat_wo_clustering.png" alt="pixelated cat without clustering">
      <p>pixelated cat without clustering</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The pixelated without clustering image is a surprisingly good representation of the original image, we can even still see the green eyes and the pink nose.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4 d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="/assets/img/projects/pixelate_kmeans/cat_sil_clustering.png" alt="pixelated cat with sil clustering">
      <p>pixelated cat with sil clustering</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4 d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="/assets/img/projects/pixelate_kmeans/cat_db_clustering.png" alt="pixelated cat with db clustering">
      <p>pixelated cat with db clustering</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4 d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="/assets/img/projects/pixelate_kmeans/cat_ch_clustering.png" alt="pixelated cat with ch clustering">
      <p>pixelated cat with ch clustering</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Both sil and db methods found the optimal number of clusters == 4, where as the ch_method found 11 (with 12 being the maximum number of clusters as passed in the parameters). I would argue even with only 4 colors, the pixelated image is till a pretty decent representation of the original image, but since the background of the image is white, some lighter colored pixels in the image are replaced with white when the number of clusters == 4, which I did not like. The green eyes and the pink nose are also now replaced with generic brown colors after clustering.</p>
  <!-- Tofu -->
  <h4 class='mb-3'><u>Tofu</u></h4>
  <p>Since the previous image contained only plain background with mostly brown colors, I wanted to try an image with more colors and with a busy background. So I used an image of our dog Tofu wrapped in a blanket. I went straight to with clustering this time, since the main goal of this project is color reduction. The original image size was reduced by setting resize_ratio=0.2 and I used grid_size=8.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="/assets/img/projects/pixelate_kmeans/tofu_original.png" alt="original Tofu image">

      <p>pixelated Tofu with ch clustering</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Similar to the previous experiment, both sil and db methods reduced the number of colors drastically, in this case, the number of colors were reduce to only 2 (which is the minimum as defined in the class). The ch method image is better, but really not that great, the finer details of her face is no longer visible, this might be attributable to a larger grid_size as more pixels are now been combined together to one grid.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center">

    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- Tux -->
  <h4 class='mb-3'><u>Tux</u></h4>
  <p>I am now curious to see how the pixelation would turn out if the grid_size is set to 1, meaning the pixels in the original image are retained and not aggregated to grids. For this experiment, I used an image of our cat Tux, he is a black cat so I figured the algorithm might struggle since we often struggle with even taking clear photos and videos of him as the camera keeps going out of focus because of his fur. I used an image editor tool to remove the background from the original image and reduced the original image size by setting resize_ratio=0.1.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="/assets/img/projects/pixelate_kmeans/tux_original.png" alt="original Tux image">

      <p>pixelated Tux with ch clustering</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I knew there was probably no point in trying the sil and db methods since these two methods seem to tend to reduce the number of clusters drastically, so I went ahead with the ch method with maximum number of clusters set to 12. The algorithm selected 10 centroids and the rendered pixelated image is actually pretty good, his facial features are still clearly visible, as well as his yellow eyes.</p>
  <!-- Miata -->
  <h4 class='mb-3'><u>Miata</u></h4>
  <p>Since I've only experimented with animals so far, I figured I should try something different next. So I used an image of our Miata, a happy little car that we love (if you don't have one, you should!). I reduced the original image size by passing in resize_ratio=0.1 and used grid_size=5.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6 d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center">
      <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="/assets/img/projects/pixelate_kmeans/miata_original.png" alt="original Miata image">

      <p>pixelated Miata without clustering</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The pixelated without clustering image is again a very good representation of the original image, we can still see some of the trees in the background and the curb at the front.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4 d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center">

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Similar to the previous experiments, both db and sil methods reduced the number of colors drastically (only 3 colors), while the ch method reduced the number of colors to 11. Even with only 3 colors, the car is still clearly visible, although there is now more noise in the background as some of the green colors in the background is now replaced with red (interesting), and the reflection on the hood is not as crisp. The one with ch method is certainly a better representation, but in all of them, the red roof is now no longer visible, perhaps this could be improved by reducing the grid_size. Also I feel 11 colors is still too many colors, since we can see that the image was rendered decently well with only 3 colors, so perhaps we could reduce the number of clusters.</p>
  <p>So I then tried reducing the grid_size to 3 and reducing the maximum number of clusters to 7, with ch method, which reduced the optimal number of clusters to 5, with below 5 colors as the centroids. This is now looking really amazing! I love how the Miata came out, and the colors adds a 'retro' look to the image, which fits the car just perfectly!</p>

  <p>But remember I mentioned that I started this project because I wanted to create a way to make pixelated images for crocheting blankets? Since I did not have the yarn colors that match the centroids, I needed to replace some of the centroid colors with the yarn colors that I had. Here are two versions based on the yarn colors I had at hand. I combined the two redish colors to red and replaced the greyish blue color and the light purple color respectively. The manually adjusted versions are certainly not as nice as the originally rendered version, but the one with white and grey (the one on the right) actually turned out looking decent. I am still working on the blanket at the time of writing, but I'll be sure to show you the finished blanket when it's done! The code used to manually adjust the centroid colors can be found in the 'miata.ipynb' notebook on the GitHub.</p>

  <h3 class='mb-3'><u>CONCLUSION</u></h3>
  <p>That's it for this project, I had a lot of fun working on it and will certainly be using the code in my crochet projects. The code could definitely be optimized, especially since the code is currently processing the grids sequentially, but perhaps there is a way to better parallelize the process, which I will work on next!</p>
